# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver

This project implements a heuristic solver for the **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, using instance data from `.txt` files.

## What does the project do?

- Reads VRP instances from UTF-8-encoded .txt files.
- Applies a Nearest Neighbor heuristic with capability validation.
- Displays results with optimized paths and statistics.

## How to install it?

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/BGPL20/Vehicle-Routing-Problem-VRP-.git
cd Vehicle-Routing-Problem-VRP-/VRP_Instance_V3
```
